Feature: View recipe of custom drinks 

As a user, I want to be able to view a list of all of my public and private custom made drink recipes so that I have an easy access to all of my custom made recipes, like a personal recipe book

Background: 
	Given the following accounts exist in the system:
		| username | password      |
		| User1    | userpassword1 |
		| User2    | userpassword2 |
		| User3    | userpassword3 |
	Given the following drinks exist in the system:
		| name     | likes | ingredients           	                       | author | status |

		| Mojitos  | 0     | white rum, sugar,lime juice,soda water,mint   | User2  | public |
	
	Scenario: User view all of their custom drink recipes
	
	The list of custom drink, private and public, is displayed

    When the user "<username>" with password "<password>" is logged into their account
	And the user "<username>" displays the list of custom drinks
	Then the custom drinks "<customdrinklist>" with author "<username>" shall be displayed
