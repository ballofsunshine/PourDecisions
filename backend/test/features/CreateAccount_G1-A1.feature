Feature: Create an account

As a guest I would like to create a user account so that I can
have my changes saved and be able to create custom drinks and like drinks

Scenario: Create a user account with a unique username and password.

#I should be able to create a user account successfully 

	Given the username "<username>" does not already exist 
	When I create a user account with username "<username>" and password "<password>"
  Then the account shall have username "<username>" and password "<password>"
	Then I should be logged in as user "<username>"

Examples:
| username | password |
| Fiona    | psd22123123    |

Scenario: Create a user account with a unique username and unique password.

#This doesnt make sense ???

  Then the account shall have username "<username>" and password "<password>"
	Then I should be logged in as user "<username>"

Scenario: Create a user account with a existing username.

#I should not be able to create a user account with a username which exists 

	Given the account with the username "<username>" and password "<password>" already exists

  Then no new account shall be created
	And an error message "<error>" shall be raised
