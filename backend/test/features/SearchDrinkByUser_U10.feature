Feature: Search a custom drink

As a user I would like to search for custom drinks by the name of a user so that
if this user is known for making great recipes, I can browse their other drink recipes and try some new ones
Background:
    Given the following accounts exist in the system:
        | username   | password   |
        | user1 | userpassword1 |
		
	Given the following drinks exist in the system:
		| name     | likes | ingredients | author | status |
        | Margarita| 7     | yep         | user1  | public |
        | Kiwi Mojito | 12     | kiwi         | user1  | public |
        | Random drink | 23 | blah | notuser1 | public |

Scenario: Search a custom drink with an existing user

I should be able to view all drinks created by the searched user with their ratings successfully

    When the user "user1" with password "userpassword1" is logged into their account
	And the user searches a drink made by "user1"
	Then the list of drinks shall be "Margarita,Kiwi Mojito"

Scenario: Search a custom drink with a user which does not exist

I should not be able to view all drinks created by the user which does not exist

    When the user "user1" with password "userpassword1" is logged into their account
	And the user searches a drink made by "nonexistentuser"
	Then an error message "SEARCH-INVALID-USER" shall be raised
