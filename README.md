# PourDecisions - a service to manage, create, and discover drinks

PourDecisions is an online service that contains a database of adult beverages (i.e., cocktails and mocktails). Users can add their own custom drink recipes to the database and these recipes can be rated by other users or favourited. Users can also use the app to determine what drinks they can currently make in their household by inputting ingredients they have and the app will return drink recipes that can be made with the inputted ingredients. Users would need to login to see their favourites and recipes theyâ€™ve created, otherwise they can access the website/app as a guest without being able to use those features or rate recipes.
